# Stanford-Data-Journalism
## Public Affairs Data Journalism Stanford Class

### This is my **initial** posting on GitHub following along with the _Public Affairs Data Journalism Course_ from Stanford.

The first assignment from [this link](http://www.padjo.org/2014-09-23/#homework-details) was to post something in markdown on my README master branch. ~~Hopefully I don't screw this up~~

I am hoping that this course will help me refine both my data analysis and journalistic skills. I anticipate writing a good amount of `code`, but also sharpening my story-finding and story-telling instincts. 

More tangibly, while I shadow this course I am looking to accomplish these tasks:
-Develop a mastery of Excel for data cleaning and analysis.
-Obtain a working knowledge of at least one maping software.
-Achieve a comfort with the GitHub interface so that I can use it for other individual projects.
-Manage databases in a coherent and useful way.

I am working to make this the beginning of a long and fruitful career. One of the most powerful things I already learned from the first lesson in the course was this from Nate Silver's ["What the Fox Knows"](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-fox-knows/)
>You may have heard the phrase the plural of anecdote is not data. It turns out that this is a misquote. The original aphorism, by the political scientist Ray Wolfinger, was just the opposite: The plural of anecdote is data.
>Wolfinger’s formulation makes sense: Data does not have a virgin birth. It comes to us from somewhere. Someone set up a procedure to collect and record it. Sometimes this person is a scientist, but she also could be a journalist.

Here is to my Data Journalism journey!


## I created a new branch titled Data-Report-Critique to complete the additional section of the first assignment.

The assignment entailed this: Find a story that purports to use data, read it, and answer the following questions:

1. What are the datasets used here, and where did they come from?
2. What is the “birth story” of the data, e.g. how were they created in the first place?
3. What claims does the story make based on the data?
4. What are the limitations of the data?
5. Can you find where this (original) data exists online? If so, post the relevant URLs.

I will be critiquing a piece from the New York Times' _The Upshot_ about [How far away the typical American lives from their mother](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/24/upshot/24up-family.html)

1. What are the datasets used here, and where did they come from?
  -It looks like QUOCTRUNG BUI and CLAIRE CAIN MILLER from NYT's _The Upshot_ used data they found from a [Health and Retirement Survey](https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/data-products) that was administered by the University of Michigan. The authors then created a heat map of the US that was split up into nine regions. This map provided the aggregate median distance between the residence of the retirees surveyed their children's.
2. What is the “birth story” of the data, e.g. how were they created in the first place?
  - On the survey's website the study is described as "A public resource for data on aging in America since 1990" and elaborates that     >The University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a longitudinal panel study that surveys a representative sample of approximately 20,000 people in America, supported by the National Institute on Aging (NIA U01AG009740) and the Social Security Administration. Through its unique and in-depth interviews, the HRS provides an invaluable and growing body of multidisciplinary data that researchers can use to address important questions about the challenges and opportunities of aging." 
It looks like this study is one seed of a broader crop of data that has been collected since **before I was born** to analyze the impacts of aging in America. _The Upshot_ authors took a snapshot of that data and broke it up by region.
3. What claims does the story make based on the data?
  - Based on this and other data the piece makes a number of claims. Mainly, "The typical adult lives only 18 miles from his or her     mother." But also, "Americans have become less mobile, and most adults – especially those with less education or lower incomes — do not venture far from their hometowns". Additionally, "people’s proximity to their parents is a reflection of opportunity: The biggest determinants of how far people venture from home are education and income." They authors also touch on the changing role of women as caretakers and how that had an impact not only on why mothers were chosen as the parent to measure distance from ("Researchers often study the distance from mothers because they are more likely to be caregivers and to live longer than men.") but also "Now that most women also have jobs, if the family doesn’t have extra income to pay for  child care or elder care, the financial and time strain become intense." For the future, the article warns that "Researchers say that to prepare for the influx of aging baby boomers, Americans will need to create new options for elder care, like more affordable, professional caregivers to help family members, or group living arrangements in which elderly people can help one another."
4. What are the limitations of the data?
  - It looks like the data is self-reported from the mothers as retirees so there may be reason to question the exact accuracy of the distances reported. Also, there was no specification of potential outliers (people who live/work abroad) and how those outliers might have impacted the analysis of the data. Furthermore, although there is mention of the different racial differences in the article later on, I don't know if the authors themselves analyzed the data on those parameters and if they could have done a more in-depth look on those factors.
5. Can you find where the (original) data exists online? If so, post the relevant URLs.
  - This [online pdf](http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/modules/meta/2016/core/desc/h16dd.pdf) from the survey website outlines the steps that need to be taken to obtain the data.
