# Stanford-Data-Journalism
## Public Affairs Data Journalism Stanford Class

### This is my **initial** posting on GitHub following along with the _Public Affairs Data Journalism Course_ from Stanford.

The first assignment from [this link](http://www.padjo.org/2014-09-23/#homework-details) was to post something in markdown on my README master branch. ~~Hopefully I don't screw this up~~

I am hoping that this course will help me refine both my data analysis and journalistic skills. I anticipate writing a good amount of `code`, but also sharpening my story-finding and story-telling instincts. 

More tangibly, while I shadow this course I am looking to accomplish these tasks:
-Develop a mastery of Excel for data cleaning and analysis.
-Obtain a working knowledge of at least one maping software.
-Achieve a comfort with the GitHub interface so that I can use it for other individual projects.
-Manage databases in a coherent and useful way.

I am working to make this the beginning of a long and fruitful career. One of the most powerful things I already learned from the first lesson in the course was this from Nate Silver's ["What the Fox Knows"](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-fox-knows/)
>You may have heard the phrase the plural of anecdote is not data. It turns out that this is a misquote. The original aphorism, by the political scientist Ray Wolfinger, was just the opposite: The plural of anecdote is data.
>Wolfinger’s formulation makes sense: Data does not have a virgin birth. It comes to us from somewhere. Someone set up a procedure to collect and record it. Sometimes this person is a scientist, but she also could be a journalist.

Here is to my Data Journalism journey!
